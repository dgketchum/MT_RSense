======================================================================================
 The "time_series" module is part of the "dnppy" package (develop national program py).
 This module houses a time_series class, which has bundled many methods for quick and
 easy handling of time_series data, usually on the scale of days to years, but can also
 handle hourly, minutely, and 1 second resolution time_data pretty well.

 If you wrote a function you think should be added to this module, or have an idea for one
 you wish was available, please email the Geoinformatics Fellow class or code it up yourself!
